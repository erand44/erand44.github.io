This site was completed after 7 intense hours of non-stop coding — finally wrapped up at 12:18 AM.
It’s the result of focus, effort, and excitement for what I’m building as a developer.
Every part of this portfolio reflects my current skill set and growth on this journey.
I plan to continue improving it as I learn more and take on new challenges. 
Thanks for stopping by — I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I enjoyed creating it.
